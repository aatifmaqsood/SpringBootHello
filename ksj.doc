Objective:
This document defines the reference architecture and behavioral standards for Kubernetes Scaling Jobs (KSJ) used for asynchronous message processing in our platform. It outlines how we prefer a KSJ to function, handles edge cases, and defines default configurations for KEDA, SQS, and job lifecycle.


Summary
1) A Kubernetes Scaling Job (KSJ) is designed to:
2) Dynamically scale based on queue depth using KEDA
3) Process messages from SQS
4) Ensure messages are reliably handled, retried if needed, and never lost silently
5) Provide observability through structured logs
6) Be resilient to failures and handle graceful shutdowns
