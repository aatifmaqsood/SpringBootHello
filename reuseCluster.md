High-Level Design:

The high-level design consists of the following components:

Cluster Repository: A database that stores information about existing EMR clusters, including their status, configuration, and workload.
Job Scheduler: A component that schedules jobs on the cluster based on their priority and the cluster's availability.
Lambda Function: A serverless function that checks the state of the cluster to determine if it is running or needs to be started.
EMR Cluster: An Amazon EMR cluster that can be reused for new jobs.
Cluster Reuse Service: A component that checks the cluster repository for available clusters and reuses them for new jobs.

System Workflow:

A new job is submitted to the job scheduler.
The job scheduler checks the cluster repository for an available cluster.
If an available cluster is found, the cluster reuse service reuses the cluster for the new job.
The Lambda function is triggered to check the state of the cluster.
If the cluster is not running, the Lambda function starts the cluster.
The new job is executed on the reused cluster.

Changes to Step Function:

To implement cluster reuse in the Step Function, the following changes are suggested:

Add a new state: Add a new state to the Step Function that checks the cluster repository for an available cluster.
Update the job scheduler: Modify the job scheduler to check the cluster repository for an available cluster and reuse it for the new job.
Add a Lambda function: Add a Lambda function to the Step Function that checks the state of the cluster and starts it if necessary.
Update the EMR cluster creation: Modify the EMR cluster creation state to reuse an existing cluster if one is available.
