Overview:
KEDA (Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaler) enables Kubernetes workloads to autoscale based on the number of events or messages in external systems such as message queues, databases, or cloud services. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis is a high-performance messaging broker often used for enterprise-grade messaging scenarios.

Integrating KEDA with Artemis allows our workloads to scale based on the depth of a queue/topic in Artemis, helping achieve efficient resource utilization and responsiveness.
