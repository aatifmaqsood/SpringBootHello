Message Visibility Timeout: 
message visibility timeout is the period a message becomes invisible to other consumers after being read, until:

a) It’s deleted (job succeeded), or

b) Timeout expires (job failed or took too long).

For KSJ patterns (Kubernetes-based consumers reading messages and doing async jobs), this visibility timeout must align with the job duration. Misalignment causes:

a) Duplicate processing

b) Wasted resources

c) Harder failure tracing

  Should It Be Dynamically Increased?
Option A: Fixed Visibility Timeout
Set to the maximum expected processing time.

✅ Simple to manage

❌ Risk of long delays before reprocessing on failure

Option B: Dynamically Extend (Best Practice)
When a job starts, set initial visibility timeout (e.g., 30s).

While processing, periodically extend it using ChangeMessageVisibility.

Allows:

Short timeout by default (faster recovery on crash)

Long jobs to complete without duplication
