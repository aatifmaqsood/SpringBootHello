**Approach 1: Enhanced Existing Pipeline**
  ## Overview: Enhanced Existing Pipeline** is a modification strategy that extends the current `selfservicepipeline` to support production environments by adding production detection logic and skipping the automatic PR creation step. This approach leverages existing infrastructure and team knowledge, requiring minimal changes to the current system while adding production support capabilities.
    **Goal**: Help dev teams review CPU recommendations and decide whether to create PRs based on service CPU utilization analysis.
    **Summary**: This approach extends the existing pipeline infrastructure to support production environments by implementing production detection logic and CPU utilization analysis capabilities. The system reuses the current pipeline framework while adding new functionality to analyze service CPU utilization patterns and generate data-driven optimization recommendations. When production environments are detected, the pipeline skips automatic PR creation and instead sends email notifications with links, allowing dev teams to review the CPU data and recommendations before deciding whether to create PRs. This approach maintains all existing dev/qa workflows while seamlessly adding production analysis capabilities, providing a smooth transition for teams already familiar with the current system.
