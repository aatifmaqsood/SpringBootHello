**Approach 1: Enhanced Existing Pipeline**
  ## Overview: Enhanced Existing Pipeline is a modification strategy that extends the current `selfservicepipeline` to support production environments by adding production detection logic and skipping the automatic PR creation step. This approach leverages existing infrastructure and team knowledge, requiring minimal changes to the current system while adding production support capabilities.
    **Goal**: Help dev teams review CPU recommendations and decide whether to create PRs based on service CPU utilization analysis.
    **Summary**: This approach extends the existing pipeline infrastructure to support production environments by implementing production detection logic and CPU utilization analysis capabilities. The system reuses the current pipeline framework while adding new functionality to analyze service CPU utilization patterns and generate data-driven optimization recommendations. When production environments are detected, the pipeline skips automatic PR creation and instead sends email notifications with links, allowing dev teams to review the CPU data and recommendations before deciding whether to create PRs. This approach maintains all existing dev/qa workflows while seamlessly adding production analysis capabilities, providing a smooth transition for teams already familiar with the current system.

### Approach 2: New Dedicated Production Pipeline

**Goal**: Build production-optimized pipeline that gives users full control over resource optimization through Jenkins pipeline parameters.

**Summary**: This approach creates a completely new, production  pipeline designed specifically for production resource optimization requirements. The system is built from the ground up to provide application-centric resource analysis with comprehensive metrics and recommendations. Unlike the enhanced approach, this pipeline is manually triggered by users through Jenkins, where developers can pass application ID and CPU recommendations as parameters directly to the pipeline. The system includes built-in production safety measures and provides PR creation based on the parameters passed by developers, ensuring that all optimization decisions are user-controlled through pipeline parameters rather than automated or UI-based. This approach offers maximum flexibility and production safety by being designed specifically for production environments and integrates seamlessly with existing Jenkins workflows, though it requires more development effort and introduces a new pipeline interface for users to learn.
